# Continuous integration and default-branch gates

The `CI` GitHub Actions workflow validates the supported Expo Android source on
every pull request and on pushes to `main`.

## Checks

- **Expo quality gates** uses Node.js 20.19.x and the checked-in npm lock file
  to run `npm ci`, `npm run lint`, `npx tsc --noEmit`, and
  `npm exec -- expo-doctor`.
- **Dependency review** runs on pull requests and rejects newly introduced
  runtime vulnerabilities of moderate severity or higher. It keeps the
  official action's license inspection enabled without defining a separate
  repository allowlist or denylist.
- **CodeQL** uses GitHub's default setup and default query suite to analyze
  JavaScript/TypeScript and GitHub Actions code on pull requests,
  default-branch updates, and GitHub's scheduled cadence.

The workflows do not create an Android build, upload artifacts, start the API,
or access an emulator. Each job has a bounded timeout, and a newer run for the
same pull request or branch cancels an older run.

## Permissions and configuration

The checked-in workflows grant the GitHub token read-only repository-content
access and disable credential persistence after checkout. Pull-request code
receives no write permission, Expo token, signing credential, deployment
credential, environment secret, or repository secret. Official GitHub actions
are pinned to reviewed commit SHAs so a mutable tag cannot silently change the
code executed by CI.

No secret or provider credential is required. CI does not start the app or API,
connect to metadata providers, initialize Expo SQLite, or create a local
database.

## Protected `main` policy

The active repository ruleset named **Protect main quality and security gates**
targets only the default branch. It:

- requires changes to reach `main` through a pull request;
- requires the `Expo quality gates` and `Dependency review` status checks
  against the latest `main` state;
- requires CodeQL code-scanning results and blocks error-level quality alerts or
  high-or-higher security alerts;
- blocks force pushes and deletion of `main`; and
- defines no routine bypass actor.

The required independent approval count is intentionally zero while MediaVault
has one maintainer. Requiring the only maintainer to obtain an independent
approval would make routine maintenance impossible. Raise the count to one as
soon as a trusted reviewer can reliably review changes; this is an explicit
solo-maintainer compromise, not independent review.

### Renaming a required check

Workflow and job names are repository policy because GitHub uses their exact
check contexts. Before intentionally renaming a required job:

1. keep the existing required context active;
2. introduce the new name on a pull request and wait for its successful check;
3. update the ruleset to require the new exact context while retaining the old
   one;
4. verify a fresh pull-request commit reports every required check and remains
   blocked while any one is pending; then
5. remove the obsolete context from the ruleset and workflow.

For CodeQL default setup, keep the ruleset's required tool name `CodeQL` aligned
with the tool reported by GitHub code scanning. Re-verify the ruleset after any
switch between default and advanced setup.

### Emergency recovery

There is no standing administrator or maintainer bypass. If a GitHub outage or
misconfigured required check blocks an urgent security or repository-recovery
change, the repository owner may temporarily edit the ruleset in **Settings >
Rules > Rulesets**. Record the reason, affected commit or pull request, time,
and exact temporary change in the relevant private operational record; use the
narrowest change; restore the ruleset immediately; and re-run the API checks
below. Do not use this path for routine merges or to ignore a failing check.

After any ruleset or workflow change, verify the live policy:

```powershell
gh api repos/Megaraz/media-vault-android/code-scanning/default-setup
gh api repos/Megaraz/media-vault-android/rulesets
gh api repos/Megaraz/media-vault-android/rules/branches/main
```

## Run the same checks locally

From the repository root:

```powershell
npm ci
npm run lint
npx tsc --noEmit
npm exec -- expo-doctor
```

Generated native folders, Expo state, build output, environment files, signing
material, local databases, and `node_modules` are ignored and must not be
committed.
